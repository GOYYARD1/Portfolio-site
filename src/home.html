<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
Hello my name is Cephas Munene Njiru. 
I’m an IT student aspiring to get into the Cybersecurity industry. 
Aiming for the Blue Team and SOC practitioner, 
I’m focused on strengthening defenses through 
proactive monitoring, incident response, and threat detection. 
I come from a background shaped by problem-solving, 
analytical thinking, and a strong security-first mindset. 
I approach challenges by breaking them down 
logically, understanding root causes, and 
designing solutions that are both practical and resilient. 
This mindset naturally led me into Cybersecurity, 
where protecting systems, analyzing threats, and 
strengthening defenses align with how I think and work.

    <section>
    This website is both a professional portfolio and a cybersecurity asset.
    It is designed, deployed, monitored, and defended as part of a blue team / SOC project.
